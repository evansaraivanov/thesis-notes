	abstract = {Quantifying tensions ‚Äî inconsistencies amongst measurements of cosmological parameters by diÔ¨Äerent experiments ‚Äî has emerged as a crucial part of modern cosmological data analysis. Statistically-signiÔ¨Åcant tensions between two experiments or cosmological probes may indicate new physics extending beyond the standard cosmological model and need to be promptly identiÔ¨Åed. We apply several tension estimators proposed in the literature to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) large-scale structure measurement and Planck cosmic microwave background data. We Ô¨Årst evaluate the responsiveness of these metrics to an input tension artiÔ¨Åcially introduced between the two, using synthetic DES data. We then apply the metrics to the comparison of Planck and actual DES Year 1 data. We Ô¨Ånd that the parameter diÔ¨Äerences, Eigentension, and Suspiciousness metrics all yield similar results on both simulated and real data, while the Bayes ratio is inconsistent with the rest due to its dependence on the prior volume. Using these metrics, we calculate the tension between DES Year 1 3 √ó 2pt and Planck, Ô¨Ånding the surveys to be in ‚àº 2.3ùúé tension under the ŒõCDM paradigm. This suite of metrics provides a toolset for robustly testing tensions in the DES Year 3 data and beyond.},

The emulators replace the computation of matter and CMB power spectra from Boltzmann codes; thus, they do not need to be re-trained for different choices of astrophysical nuisance parameters or redshift distributions. The matter power spectrum emulation error is less than \$0.4{\textbackslash}\%\$ in the wavenumber range \$k {\textbackslash}in [10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}, 10] {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, for redshift \$z {\textbackslash}in [0, 5]\$. \${\textbackslash}it\{CosmoPower\}\$ emulates CMB temperature, polarisation and lensing potential power spectra in the \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ region of parameter space around the \${\textbackslash}it\{Planck\}\$ best fit values with an error \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the expected shot noise for the forthcoming Simons Observatory. \${\textbackslash}it\{CosmoPower\}\$ is showcased on a joint cosmic shear and galaxy clustering analysis from the Kilo-Degree Survey, as well as on a Stage IV \${\textbackslash}it\{Euclid\}\$-like simulated cosmic shear analysis. For the CMB case, \${\textbackslash}it\{CosmoPower\}\$ is tested on a \${\textbackslash}it\{Planck\}\$ 2018 CMB temperature and polarisation analysis. The emulators always recover the fiducial cosmological constraints with differences in the posteriors smaller than sampling noise, while providing a speed-up factor up to \$O(10{\textasciicircum}4)\$ to the complete inference pipeline. This acceleration allows posterior distributions to be recovered in just a few seconds, as we demonstrate in the \${\textbackslash}it\{Planck\}\$ likelihood case. \${\textbackslash}it\{CosmoPower\}\$ is written entirely in Python, can be interfaced with all commonly used cosmological samplers and is publicly available at https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower .},

We introduce a simple modiÔ¨Åcation for autoencoder neural networks that yields powerful generative models. Our method masks the autoencoder‚Äôs parameters to respect autoregressive constraints: each input is reconstructed only from previous inputs in a given ordering. Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a set of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint probability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint probability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be applied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized implementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate that this approach is competitive with stateof-the-art tractable distribution estimators. At test time, the method is signiÔ¨Åcantly faster and scales better than other autoregressive estimators.},

With only the standard active neutrinos and power-law scalar spectra, this detection is in tension with the upper limit of r{\textless}0.11 (95\% confidence) from the lack of a corresponding low multipole excess in the temperature anisotropy from gravitational waves. An extra sterile species with the same energy density as is needed to reconcile the CMB data with H0 measurements can also alleviate this new tension. By combining data from the Planck and ACT/SPT temperature spectra, WMAP9 polarization, H\_0, baryon acoustic oscillation and local cluster abundance measurements with BICEP2 data, we find the joint evidence for a sterile massive neutrino increases to DeltaNeff=0.98{\textbackslash}pm 0.26 for the effective number and ms= 0.52{\textbackslash}pm 0.13 eV for the effective mass or 3.8 sigma and 4 sigma evidence respectively. We caution the reader that these results correspond to a joint statistical evidence and, in addition, astrophysical systematic errors in the clusters and H0 measurements, and small-scale CMB data could weaken our conclusions.},

For the DES-Y1 data we find no detectable tension between growth and geometry meta-parameters in both the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM and \$w\$CDM parameter space.

	abstract = {The wealth of incoming and future cosmological observations will allow us to map out the structure and evolution of the observable universe to an unprecedented level of precision. Among these observations is the weak gravitational lensing of galaxies, e.g., cosmic shear that measures the minute distortions of background galaxy images by intervening cosmic structure. Weak lensing and cosmic shear promise to be a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology, constraining models of dark energy, measuring the evolution of structure in the universe, and testing theories of gravity on cosmic scales. However, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies ‚Äì their shape and orientation before being lensed ‚Äì may pose a great challenge to the use of weak gravitational lensing as an accurate cosmological probe, and has been identiÔ¨Åed as one of the primary physical systematic biases in cosmic shear studies. Correlations between this intrinsic alignment and the lensing signal can persist even for large physical separations, and isolating the eÔ¨Äect of intrinsic alignment from weak lensing is not trivial. A great deal of work in the last two decades has been devoted to understanding and characterizing this intrinsic alignment, which is also a direct and complementary probe of structure formation and evolution in its own right. In this review, we report in a systematic way the state of our understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, with a particular emphasis on its large-scale impact on weak lensing measurements and methods for its isolation or mitigation. We begin with an introduction to the use of cosmic shear as a probe for cosmology and describe the various physical contributions by intrinsic alignment to the shear or convergence 2- and 3point correlations. We then review developments in the modeling of the intrinsic alignment signal, including a trend toward attempting to incorporate more accurate nonlinear and single halo eÔ¨Äects. The impact on cosmological constraints by the intrinsic alignment of galaxies is also outlined based on these models. We then summarize direct measurements of the large-scale intrinsic alignment signal in various surveys and discuss their constraints on models of intrinsic alignment, as well as progress in utilizing numerical simulations of structure formation to further our understanding of intrinsic alignment. Finally, we outline the development of a variety of mitigation techniques for reducing the impact of the intrinsic alignment contamination on weak lensing signals both within a galaxy data set and between complementary probes of gravitational lensing. The methodology and projected impact of these techniques are discussed for both 2- and 3-point correlations. We conclude by presenting a summary and outlook on the state of intrinsic alignment study and its impact on ongoing and planned weak lensing surveys.},

	abstract = {Cosmic shear constrains cosmology by exploiting the apparent alignments of pairs of galaxies due to gravitational lensing by intervening mass clumps. However galaxies may become (intrinsically) aligned with each other, and with nearby mass clumps, during their formation. This eÔ¨Äect needs to be disentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology. We use the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to an alternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the dark energy equation of state is biased by ‚àº 50 per cent. We examine how the number of tomographic redshift bins aÔ¨Äects uncertainties on cosmological parameters and Ô¨Ånd that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as many bins are required to obtain 80 per cent of the available information. We investigate how the degradation in the dark energy Ô¨Ågure of merit depends on the photometric redshift scatter. Previous studies have shown that lensing does not place stringent requirements on the photometric redshift uncertainty, so long as the uncertainty is well known. However, if intrinsic alignments are included the requirements become a factor of three tighter. These results are quite insensitive to the fraction of catastrophic outliers, assuming that this fraction is well known. We show the eÔ¨Äect of uncertainties in photometric redshift bias and scatter. Finally we quantify how priors on the intrinsic alignment model would improve dark energy constraints.},

	abstract = {Forthcoming large-scale surveys will soon attempt to measure cosmic shear to an unprecedented level of accuracy, requiring a similarly high level of accuracy in the shear measurements of galaxies. Factors such as pixelisation, imperfect point-spread function (PSF) correction, and pixel noise can all directly or indirectly lead to biases in shear measurements, and so it can be necessary for shear measurement methods to be calibrated against internal, external, or simulated data to minimize bias. It is thus important to understand the nature of this calibration. In this paper, we show that a typical calibration procedure will on average leave no residual additive bias, but will leave a residual multiplicative bias. Additionally, the errors on the post-calibration bias parameters will be changed, and on average increased, from the errors on the pre-calibration measurements of these parameters, but that this is generally worth the beneÔ¨Åt in decreasing the expected value of the multiplicative bias. We Ô¨Ånd that in most typical cases, it is worthwhile to apply a Ô¨Årst-order bias correction, while a higher-order bias correction is only worthwhile for methods with intrinsically high multiplicative bias ({\textgreater} 10 per cent) or when the simulation size is very small ({\textless} 106 simulated galaxies).},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the Ô¨Ånal full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to signiÔ¨Åcant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to aÔ¨Äect them only at the 0.5 œÉ level. We Ô¨Ånd good consistency with the standard spatially-Ô¨Çat 6-parameter ŒõCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ‚Äúbase ŒõCDM‚Äù in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density Œ©ch2 = 0.120 ¬± 0.001, baryon density Œ©bh2 = 0.0224 ¬± 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 ¬± 0.004, and optical depth œÑ = 0.054 ¬± 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68 \% conÔ¨Ådence regions on measured parameters and 95 \% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03 \% precision, with 100Œ∏‚àó = 1.0411 ¬± 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-ŒõCDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4¬±0.5) km s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1; matter density parameter Œ©m = 0.315¬±0.007; and matter Ô¨Çuctuation amplitude œÉ8 = 0.811¬±0.006. We Ô¨Ånd no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-ŒõCDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the eÔ¨Äective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be NeÔ¨Ä = 2.99 ¬± 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction NeÔ¨Ä = 3.046, and Ô¨Ånd that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to mŒΩ {\textless} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base ŒõCDM at over 2 œÉ, which pulls some parameters that aÔ¨Äect the lensing amplitude away from the ŒõCDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a Ô¨Çat universe, Œ©K = 0.001¬±0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = ‚àí1.03 ¬± 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We Ô¨Ånd no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {\textless} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-ŒõCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-ŒõCDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey‚Äôs combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower Ô¨Çuctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in signiÔ¨Åcant, 3.6 œÉ, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

	abstract = {We present a new, updated version of the EuclidEmulator (called EuclidEmulator2), a fast and accurate predictor for the nonlinear correction of the matter power spectrum. Percent-level accurate emulation is now supported in the eight-dimensional parameter space of ùë§0ùë§ùëéCDM+ ùëöùúà models between redshift ùëß = 0 and ùëß = 3 for spatial scales within the range 0.01 ‚Ñé Mpc‚àí1 ‚â§ ùëò ‚â§ 10 ‚Ñé Mpc‚àí1. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, we have had to improve the quality of the underlying N-body simulations used as training data: (i) we use self-consistent linear evolution of non-dark matter species such as massive neutrinos, photons, dark energy and the metric Ô¨Åeld, (ii) we perform the simulations in the so-called N-body gauge, which allows one to interpret the results in the framework of general relativity, (iii) we run over 250 high-resolution simulations with 30003 particles in boxes of 1(‚Ñé‚àí1 Gpc)3 volumes based on paired-and-Ô¨Åxed initial conditions and (iv) we provide a resolution correction that can be applied to emulated results as a post-processing step in order to drastically reduce systematic biases on small scales due to residual resolution eÔ¨Äects in the simulations. We Ô¨Ånd that the inclusion of the dynamical dark energy parameter ùë§ùëé signiÔ¨Åcantly increases the complexity and expense of creating the emulator. The high Ô¨Ådelity of EuclidEmulator2 is tested in various comparisons against N-body simulations as well as alternative fast predictors like HALOFIT, HMCode and CosmicEmu. A blind test is successfully performed against the Euclid Flagship v2.0 simulation.

We run a large number of simulated likelihood analyses using synthetic data vectors to test the robustness of our baseline analysis. We demonstrate that the DES Year 3 modeling pipeline, including the calibrated scale cuts, is sufficiently accurate relative to the constraining power of the DES Year 3 analyses. Our systematics mitigation strategy accounts for astrophysical systematics, such as galaxy bias, intrinsic alignments, source and lens magnification, baryonic effects, and source clustering, as well as for uncertainties in modeling the matter power spectrum, reduced shear, and estimator effects. We further demonstrate excellent agreement between two independently-developed modeling pipelines, and thus rule out any residual uncertainties due to the numerical implementation.},

	abstract = {We present the first cosmology results from large-scale structure in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) spanning 5000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$. We perform an analysis combining three two-point correlation functions (3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt): (i) cosmic shear using 100 million source galaxies, (ii) galaxy clustering, and (iii) the cross-correlation of source galaxy shear with lens galaxy positions. The analysis was designed to mitigate confirmation or observer bias; we describe specific changes made to the lens galaxy sample following unblinding of the results. We model the data within the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM and \$w\$CDM cosmological models. We find consistent cosmological results between the three two-point correlation functions; their combination yields clustering amplitude \$S\_8=0.776{\textasciicircum}\{+0.017\}\_\{-0.017\}\$ and matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.339{\textasciicircum}\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM, mean with 68\% confidence limits; \$S\_8=0.775{\textasciicircum}\{+0.026\}\_\{-0.024\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.352{\textasciicircum}\{+0.035\}\_\{-0.041\}\$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter \$w=-0.98{\textasciicircum}\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.20\}\$ in \$w\$CDM. This combination of DES data is consistent with the prediction of the model favored by the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy data, which is quantified with a probability-to-exceed \$p=0.13\$ to \$0.48\$. When combining DES 3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt data with available baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift-space distortion, and type Ia supernovae data, we find \$p=0.34\$. Combining all of these data sets with Planck CMB lensing yields joint parameter constraints of \$S\_8 = 0.812{\textasciicircum}\{+0.008\}\_\{-0.008\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.306{\textasciicircum}\{+0.004\}\_\{-0.005\}\$, \$h=0.680{\textasciicircum}\{+0.004\}\_\{-0.003\}\$, and \${\textbackslash}sum m\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\}{\textless}0.13 {\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eV{\textbackslash}; (95{\textbackslash}\% {\textbackslash};CL)\}\$ in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM; \$S\_8 = 0.812{\textasciicircum}\{+0.008\}\_\{-0.008\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.302{\textasciicircum}\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.006\}\$, \$h=0.687{\textasciicircum}\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.007\}\$, and \$w=-1.031{\textasciicircum}\{+0.030\}\_\{-0.027\}\$ in \$w\$CDM.

	abstract = {The tangential shear signal receives contributions from physical scales in the galaxymatter correlation function well below the transverse scale at which it is measured. Since small scales are diÔ¨Écult to model, this non-locality has generally required stringent scale cuts or new statistics for cosmological analyses. Using the fact that uncertainty in these contributions corresponds to an uncertainty in the enclosed projected mass around the lens, we provide an analytic marginalization scheme to account for this. Our approach enables the inclusion of measurements on smaller scales without requiring numerical sampling over extra free parameters. We extend the analytic marginalization formalism to retain cosmographic (‚Äúshear-ratio‚Äù) information from small-scale measurements that would otherwise be removed due to modeling uncertainties, again without requiring the addition of extra sampling parameters. We test the methodology using simulated likelihood analysis of a DES Year 5-like galaxygalaxy lensing and galaxy clustering datavector. We demonstrate that we can remove parameter biases due to the presence of an un-modeled 1-halo contamination of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, and use the shear-ratio information on small scales to improve cosmological parameter constraints.},

	abstract = {We present the methodology for and detail the implementation of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 3x2pt DES Year 1 (Y1) analysis, which combines configuration-space two-point statistics from three different cosmological probes: cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, using data from the first year of DES observations. We have developed two independent modeling pipelines and describe the code validation process. We derive expressions for analytical real-space multi-probe covariances, and describe their validation with numerical simulations. We stress-test the inference pipelines in simulated likelihood analyses that vary 6-7 cosmology parameters plus 20 nuisance parameters and precisely resemble the analysis to be presented in the DES 3x2pt analysis paper, using a variety of simulated input data vectors with varying assumptions. We find that any disagreement between pipelines leads to changes in assigned likelihood \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}le 0.045\$ with respect to the statistical error of the DES Y1 data vector. We also find that angular binning and survey mask do not impact our analytic covariance at a significant level. We determine lower bounds on scales used for analysis of galaxy clustering (8 Mpc\${\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) and galaxy-galaxy lensing (12 Mpc\${\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) such that the impact of modeling uncertainties in the non-linear regime is well below statistical errors, and show that our analysis choices are robust against a variety of systematics. These tests demonstrate that we have a robust analysis pipeline that yields unbiased cosmological parameter inferences for the flagship 3x2pt DES Y1 analysis. We emphasize that the level of independent code development and subsequent code comparison as demonstrated in this paper is necessary to produce credible constraints from increasingly complex multi-probe analyses of current data.},

	abstract = {Galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA) are a critical uncertainty for current and future weak lensing measurements. We describe a perturbative expansion of IA, analogous to the treatment of galaxy biasing. From an astrophysical perspective, this model includes the expected large-scale alignment mechanisms for galaxies that are pressure-supported (tidal alignment) and rotation-supported (tidal torquing) as well as the cross-correlation between the two. Alternatively, this expansion can be viewed as an effective model capturing all relevant effects up to the given order. We include terms up to second order in the density and tidal fields and calculate the resulting IA contributions to two-point statistics at one-loop order. For fiducial amplitudes of the IA parameters, we find the quadratic alignment and linear-quadratic cross terms can contribute order-unity corrections to the total intrinsic alignment signal at \$k{\textbackslash}sim0.1{\textbackslash},h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\$, depending on the source redshift distribution. These contributions can lead to significant biases on inferred cosmological parameters in Stage IV photometric weak lensing surveys. We perform forecasts for an LSST-like survey, finding that use of the standard "NLA" model for intrinsic alignments cannot remove these large parameter biases, even when allowing for a more general redshift dependence. The model presented here will allow for more accurate and flexible IA treatment in weak lensing and combined probes analyses, and an implementation is made available as part of the public FAST-PT code. The model also provides a more advanced framework for understanding the underlying IA processes and their relationship to fundamental physics.},

	abstract = {We analyze Dark Energy Survey (DES) data to constrain a cosmological model where a subset of parameters -- focusing on \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ -- are split into versions associated with structure growth (e.g. \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm grow\}\$) and expansion history (e.g. \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm geo\}\$). Once the parameters have been specified for the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmological model, which includes general relativity as a theory of gravity, it uniquely predicts the evolution of both geometry (distances) and the growth of structure over cosmic time. Any inconsistency between measurements of geometry and growth could therefore indicate a breakdown of that model. Our growth-geometry split approach therefore serves as both a (largely) model-independent test for beyond-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM physics, and as a means to characterize how DES observables provide cosmological information. We analyze the same multi-probe DES data as arXiv:1811.02375 : DES Year 1 (Y1) galaxy clustering and weak lensing, which are sensitive to both growth and geometry, as well as Y1 BAO and Y3 supernovae, which probe geometry. We additionally include external geometric information from BOSS DR12 BAO and a compressed Planck 2015 likelihood, and external growth information from BOSS DR12 RSD. We find no significant disagreement with \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm grow\}={\textbackslash}Omega\_m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm geo\}\$. When DES and external data are analyzed separately, degeneracies with neutrino mass and intrinsic alignments limit our ability to measure \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm grow\}\$, but combining DES with external data allows us to constrain both growth and geometric quantities. We also consider a parameterization where we split both \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ and \$w\$, but find that even our most constraining data combination is unable to separately constrain \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm grow\}\$ and \$w{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm grow\}\$. Relative to \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM, splitting growth and geometry weakens bounds on \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ but does not alter constraints on \$h\$.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiÔ¨Åcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Such overall calibration biases cannot be detected by the standard tests such as E/B decomposition or calibration with stars.

This could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recent amplitude determinations from weak lensing. Using an elliptical Laguerre expansion method we develop a re-Gaussianization method which reduces the error to calibration error of order 1 per cent even for poorly resolved galaxies. We also discuss a new type of shear selection bias which results in up to roughly 8 percent underestimation of the signal. It is expected to scale with redshift, inducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for. Understanding and correcting for such eÔ¨Äects is crucial if weak lensing is to become a high precision probe of cosmology.},

	abstract = {We study the eÔ¨Äect of magniÔ¨Åcation in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing, using two diÔ¨Äerent lens samples: a sample of Luminous red galaxies, redMaGiC, and a sample with a redshift-dependent magnitude limit, MagLim. We account for the eÔ¨Äect of magniÔ¨Åcation on both the Ô¨Çux and size selection of galaxies, accounting for systematic eÔ¨Äects using the Balrog image simulations. We estimate the impact of magniÔ¨Åcation on the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing cosmology analysis, Ô¨Ånding it to be a signiÔ¨Åcant systematic for the MagLim sample. We show cosmological constraints from the galaxy clustering auto-correlation and galaxy-galaxy lensing signal with diÔ¨Äerent magniÔ¨Åcations priors, Ô¨Ånding broad consistency in cosmological parameters in ŒõCDM and wCDM. However, when magniÔ¨Åcation bias amplitude is allowed to be free, we Ô¨Ånd the two-point correlations functions prefer a diÔ¨Äerent amplitude to the Ô¨Åducial input derived from the image simulations. We validate the magniÔ¨Åcation analysis by comparing the cross-clustering between lens bins with the prediction from the baseline analysis, which uses only the auto-correlation of the lens bins, indicating systematics other than magniÔ¨Åcation may be the cause of the discrepancy. We show adding the cross-clustering between lens redshift bins to the Ô¨Åt signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the constraints on lens magniÔ¨Åcation parameters and allows uninformative priors to be used on magniÔ¨Åcation coeÔ¨Écients, without any loss of constraining power or prior volume concerns.},

	abstract = {This work, together with its companion paper, Secco and Samuroff et al. (2021), presents the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 cosmic shear measurements and cosmological constraints based on an analysis of over 100 million source galaxies. With the data spanning 4143 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ on the sky, divided into four redshift bins, we produce the highest significance measurement of cosmic shear to date, with a signal-to-noise of 40. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model and find a 3\% constraint of the clustering amplitude, \$S\_8{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 ({\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\} = 0.759{\textasciicircum}\{+0.025\}\_\{-0.023\}\$. A \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM-Optimized analysis, which safely includes smaller scale information, yields a 2\% precision measurement of \$S\_8= 0.772{\textasciicircum}\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.017\}\$ that is consistent with the fiducial case. The two low-redshift measurements are statistically consistent with the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background result, however, both recovered \$S\_8\$ values are lower than the high-redshift prediction by \$2.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$2.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ (\$p\$-values of 0.02 and 0.05), respectively. The measurements are shown to be internally consistent across redshift bins, angular scales and correlation functions. The analysis is demonstrated to be robust to calibration systematics, with the \$S\_8\$ posterior consistent when varying the choice of redshift calibration sample, the modeling of redshift uncertainty and methodology. Similarly, we find that the corrections included to account for the blending of galaxies shifts our best-fit \$S\_8\$ by \$0.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ without incurring a substantial increase in uncertainty. We examine the limiting factors for the precision of the cosmological constraints and find observational systematics to be subdominant to the modeling of astrophysics. Specifically, we identify the uncertainties in modeling baryonic effects and intrinsic alignments as the limiting systematics.},
