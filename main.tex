\begin{abstract}
Despite many efforts, no cosmological model has been proposed that can lower the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tension and also agree with ongoing experiments. Fortunately, however, we are approaching a great age for cosmology. In the near future, many telescopes will begin to operate, taking more detailed data than ever before. Current methods of analyzing models on real data are slow, taking multiple days or even weeks to generate the necessary data. With the number of proposed models, analyzing each of them with traditional means is futile. This thesis presents one model independent extension to the accepted model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, which splits the matter density into two components. This highlights the traditional analysis pipeline as well as presents a consistency check within cosmological analysis. This thesis then presents novel methods for using neural networks to learn the time-consuming parts of this pipeline, greatly accelerating the analysis of cosmological models. Finally, this new neural network design is applied to computing tension metrics between the upcoming LSST experiment and Planck 2018 data. Tension metrics are frequentist estimators, and thus have uncertainty. Using traditional means, the computation of these errors is intractable, but using the novel neural network the errors can be estimated in a matter of weeks.

\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to give my utmost gratitude to my family, friends, and peers, for their great assistance in my studies. My parents, Carrie and Miroslav Saraivanov, have always supported me through any decision in my life, and provided me with the emotional support one needs to achieve such a difficult and stressful feat. Despite their lack of cosmological knowledge, I am grateful for their aid in editing and revising my thesis, making sure it is formatted well and it is readable. 

My advisor, professor Vivian Miranda, has been an outstanding source of knowledge and ideas. The other masters students I have worked with during my own masters degree, Kunhao Zhong and Huangfei Xiao, have also been great for helping me to get past difficulties in my research, as well as sharing their great wealth of knowledge in cosmology. Additionally, I would like to thank Jonathan Gordon and Joshua Kable, our group's PhD student and post-doctoral researcher, for their aid in revising my thesis. Before joining this group, my background in cosmology was minimal and without each of these people, this thesis would not be possible.

To each person mentioned, I am eternally grateful for the experience I have had at Stony Brook University, in the cosmology group, and while writing.
